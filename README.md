# PyGaussInt
A Python package to generate all types molecular integrals in quantum chemistry calculations. The purpose of this package is to provide reliable numerical references for developing molecular integral features in standard production quantum chemistry codes in C++/FORTRAN, and also test new algorithms.

## Basis Set Object
The purpose of this branch is to creat a Python class which can read molecular coordinates in and assign basis functions to different atoms. Basis function information will be read in various formats (see the [Basis Set Exchange (BSE) website](www.basissetexchange.org) for details).
